API is build with Django Restful Framework (DRF)
API is currently v1 - so all the urls for api starts with "api/v1/"
Default url for web access for APIs is here: http://localhost:8000/ru/api/v1/

Every application has its own "api" folder with the needed files

There is a custom router for API - which is defined on "tourzan/api_router.py" which allows to combine all
the urls from different applications API folders.

In the file "tourzan/settings.py" you can find REST_FRAMEWORK with
DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES and DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES

I plan to use jwt authentication for mobile app and and token authentication for clients API access.
Urls for generating tokens for both of them are added to "tourzan/urls.py":

    url(r'^api/v1/api-token-auth/', obtain_jwt_token),
    url(r'^login_client/$', login_api_view, name='login_client'),

    for jwt token add such header to API request:
        Authorization       JWT jwt_token_value_here

    fot token (original):
        Authorization      Token token_value_here


Difference between them is jwt_token is not stored in the db, but it is being generated based on secret key of
the project. Original toke is stored in the db and you can assign it manually for users.
